Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In this project I work for a company called Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant. CTS has recently taken on a new client, called the Gaming Room.  In this game team members try to guess what is being drawn.  Instead of drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the object, the game will render the images from a library of drawings as clues.  Drawings are rendered at a consistent rate and are fully realized at the 30 second mark. If the team does not guess correctly before the time expires, the remaining teams will get a onetime 15 second chance to answer. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt like I understood the requirements from the gaming company Game Room fairly well and was able to come up with realistic feasable sollutions to help develop their game.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When working through the design document I found the coding particularly easier when I detialed the exact specifications of the game in the design document.  This allowed me to have a good starting framework and it made the coding process much easier. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I felt like I could have done a better job on the server side and client side planning.  To improve this part of the document I would do more research to get a better understanding of more in depth pros and cons, then detail that in my revision.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I addressed the user's needs in the design document when referring to potential hardware limitations.  Game Room wanted to make the program available for mobile users as well.  In the game they will be using high definition photos that equated to around 1.5 gigs of hard drive requirements.  I had to guage how feasable it was to have a game of that size on current mobile technology as well as potential revisions to the game such as adding more in depth pictures increasing the hard drive requirement.  Given the current amount of space on a phone currently I decided there was enough space left to warrent the game being installed locally on a phone or mobile device.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I did my best to view the request of the type of game the client wanted to create and guage that with the feasibility of releasing on the intented platforms.  I did a decent amount of research into each platform learning of the pros and cons so I could create a well informed document and plan.  I didn't know very much about the platforms I was being asked to design for, this project improved my research skills to find the answer to the problem.  This project also helped me outline and detail the problem first, which must be done before any research is started.  I will take those two lessons into my futre projects, understanding the problem fully, then getting the information to make a well informed decision.
